AO Tools Readme file

*WARNING*

Users are strongly advised to keep backups of the My Maps folder and sub-folders so that they can manually restore their work and unique configuration map.

*NEW CONFIGURATION FILE NAME AND LOCATION*

Please note that the installer places files into the "/My Maps" and the "/My Maps/AO" folders replacing outdated files with new files. Some of these files are new configuration files. This allows configuation files to be separated from the working maps and has been necessary for the developers to design an efficient installation routine, to allow users to more easily configure the tools to their needs and to minimise the chances of accidentally deleting important files. 

The configuration file, "My Maps/Mindreader.mmap" is superceded by the My "Maps/AO/mindreaderconfig.mmap" file (note the new folder location and name), if this file does not already exist in the My Map/AO folder.

*ON FIRST RUN AFTER INSTALLATION/UPDATE*

The next time these tools are used the program checks to see if a Minreader.mmap exists in the the /My Maps folder. If this file exists then it is copied to the /My Maps/AO folder and renamed to Mindreaderconfig.mmap. This ensures that a user's configuaration map is preserved.The user is informed of this during the upgrade process, Users are advised to read these messages carefuly before proceeding.

*LINKS WARNING*

Since the configuration file has changed location, MindManager will alert the user with a dialogue box that offers the choice of updating the links. The user should always respond with "NO" as this will preserve the relative links in the maps that are involved. When each map is accessed (eg. through using the O Tag) the dialogue box will appear, but it should happen only once for each map after the config file is moved to the "My Map/AO" folder.
